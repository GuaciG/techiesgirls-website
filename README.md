# TechiesGIRLS Website - Personal project.

An example of responsive website for a bootcamp for women.

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive website with several pages, in which the user could navigate between them, through the links in the navigation menu. Also, I wanted to test functionalities such as carousels for logos and reviews, using for that "Slick carousel" cdn.

It was created with HTML, CSS and javaScript and it's my first website project as a multiple page.
