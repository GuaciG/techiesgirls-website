# TechiesGIRLS Website - Personal project.

An example of **responsive website for a bootcamp for women**.

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive website with several pages, in which the user could navigate between them, through the links in the navigation menu. Also, I wanted to test functionalities such as **carousels for logos and reviews**, using for that **"Slick carousel"** ```cdn```.

```HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.8.1/slick.min.js" integrity="sha512-XtmMtDEcNz2j7ekrtHvOVR4iwwaD6o/FUJe6+Zq+HgcCsk3kj4uSQQR8weQ2QVj1o0Pk6PwYLohm206ZzNfubg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
```

It was created with HTML, CSS and javaScript and it was my first website project as a **multiple page**.
